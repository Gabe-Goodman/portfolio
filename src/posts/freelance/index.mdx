- **CSS Media Queries**: Flexible layouts and adaptive typography.
- **Netlify**: Seamless deployment and hosting solution.
- **Custom Hooks**: Modularized logic for improved maintainability.

## Responsive Design

Responsive design ensures these projects perform seamlessly across all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop monitors. Key techniques include:
